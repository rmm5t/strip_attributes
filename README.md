# StripAttributes [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/rmm5t/strip_attributes.png)](http://travis-ci.org/rmm5t/strip_attributes)

StripAttributes is an ActiveModel extension that automatically strips all
attributes of leading and trailing whitespace before validation. If the
attribute is blank, it strips the value to `nil`.

It works by adding a before_validation hook to the record.  By default, all
attributes are stripped of whitespace, but `:only` and `:except`
options can be used to limit which attributes are stripped.  Both options accept
a single attribute (`:only => :field`) or arrays of attributes (`:except =>
[:field1, :field2, :field3]`).

## Installation

Include the gem in your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "strip_attributes", "~> 1.0"
```

## Examples

### Default Behavior

```ruby
class DrunkPokerPlayer < ActiveRecord::Base
  strip_attributes
end
```

### Using `except`

```ruby
# all attributes will be stripped except :boxers
class SoberPokerPlayer < ActiveRecord::Base
  strip_attributes :except => :boxers
end
```

### Using `only`

```ruby
# only :shoe, :sock, and :glove attributes will be stripped
class ConservativePokerPlayer < ActiveRecord::Base
  strip_attributes :only => [:shoe, :sock, :glove]
end
```

### Using `:nullify => false`

```ruby
# all attributes will be stripped, but empty strings will not be translated into nil
class EmptyStringPokerPlayer < ActiveRecord::Base
  strip_attributes :nullify => false
end
```

## Usage Patterns

### Other ORMs implementing `ActiveModel`

It also works on other ActiveModel classes, such as [Mongoid](http://mongoid.org/) documents:

```ruby
class User
  include Mongoid::Document
  strip_attributes :only => :email
end
```

### Outside of Rails

If you want to use this outside of Rails, just require
`strip_attributes/active_model` and you models will get the `strip_attributes`
class method.

```ruby
require "strip_attributes/active_model"
class SomeModel < ActiveRecord::Base
  strip_attributes
end
```

## Testing

StripAttributes provides shoulda-compatible macros for easier testing of
attribute assignment.

### Setup `test_helper.rb`

To initialize, extend `StripAttributes::Shoulda::Macros` in your
`test_helper.rb`:

```ruby
require "strip_attributes/shoulda"
class Test::Unit::TestCase
  extend StripAttributes::Shoulda::Macros
end
```

### Writing Tests

And in your unit tests:

```ruby
class UserTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  should_strip_attributes :name, :email
  should_not_strip_attributes :password
end
```

## Support

Submit suggestions or feature requests as a GitHub Issue or Pull
Request (preferred). If you send a pull request, remember to update the
corresponding unit tests.  In fact, I prefer new features to be submitted in the
form of new unit tests.

## Credits

The idea was originally triggered by the information at the (now defunct) [Rails
Wiki](http://oldwiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/HowToStripWhitespaceFromModelFields)
but was modified from the original to include more idiomatic ruby and rails
support.
